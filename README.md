# VR-Tertis-Blaster
My first VR Android Game:  For a CARDBOARD Type headset that holds a Smartphone. Tetris-ish Blocks fall from sky and attempt to block your path. Just shoot them! BlueTooth JS or KB controls. Arrow keys also move and shoot. Just a coding and getting the file under the 25 mb limit practice.
