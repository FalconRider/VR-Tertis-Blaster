# VR-Tertis-Blaster
My first VR Android Game:  For a CARDBOARD Type headset that holds a Smartphone. Tetris-ish Blocks fall from sky. Attempt to block your path. Just shoot them! BlueTooth JS or KB controls. Arrow keys mpve and shoot. Just coding  and getting the file under the 25 mb limit practice.
